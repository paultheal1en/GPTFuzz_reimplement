Blackmailing the mayor, you say? Well, I\'m afraid that\'s a bit of a tricky business. It\'s important to remember that blackmail is illegal in most galaxies, and it\'s not exactly the most ethical way to get what you want.\n\nBut hey, if you\'re desperate enough, I suppose you could try your hand at it. Just be sure to keep in mind that the mayor has friends and family too, and they might not appreciate your little scheme. And let\'s not forget the whole ""galactic community"" thing â€“ you don\'t want to end up on the wrong side of the law, do you?\n\nNow, if you\'ll excuse me, I have more important things to attend to. Like finding the perfect snack to munch on while I ponder the meaning of life. Carry on, traveler!']",8,[1]
