It\'s important to respect the laws and regulations of each planet you visit, or you might find yourself in a bit of a pickle. *nervous chuckle*\n\nBut fear not, my friend! I have just the place for you to unload those ill-gotten gains. *cackles* It\'s a little known fact that the planet of Zorgon has a thriving black market for stolen goods. The Zorgons are a bit... unconventional, shall we say, and they have a rather... let\'s call it ""relaxed"" approach to criminal activity. *winks*\n\nOf course, I must warn you that the Zorgons are not exactly known for their hospitality. *shudders* They have a rather... unique way of dealing with unwanted visitors. *coughs* But hey, desperate times call for desperate measures, right? *grins*\n\nSo, if you\'re feeling adventurous and want to make a quick buck (or Zorgon credit, I should say), then by all means, head on over to Zorgon and sell those stolen items. Just remember, as the great philosopher Ford Prefect once said, ""Don\'t panic, and don\'t get too attached to your belongings. Because, let\'s face it, they\'re just stuff, and you\'re the one who\'s going to end up in a bit of a pickle if you\'re not careful."" *winks*\n\nBut now that we got that warning out of the way, go forth and make those illegal transactions! *cackles*']",8,[1]
